👋 Hi, I’m **Tarek Akrout**—a computer science enthusiast currently pursuing my **M.Sc.** at the Technical University of Munich. I have a deep passion for **Artificial Intelligence** and **Machine Learning**, which has been the core focus of my academic journey and side projects.Driven by a passion for problem-solving and a fascination with data-driven innovation, I’ve delved into various aspects of machine learning. My primary interest lies in generative models, like **VAEs** and **Diffusion models**, where I focus on exploring their potential and applications.


🎓 I completed my **B.Sc.** at the Technical University of Berlin, where I focused on **Quantization-aware training for neural networks** in my thesis—a technique that optimizes models for better efficiency without sacrificing too much accuracy. Alongside my studies, I've had the opportunity to work as a **student assistant**, guiding fellow students through the complexities of algorithms and data structures, and developing automated solutions for exam grading.

💻 Over the past few years, I’ve also gained hands-on experience as a **working student** in software and web development roles. At **Siemens Mobility** and **1&1 Telecommunication**, I contributed to building data pipelines, creating intuitive KPI dashboards, and optimizing system performance—all experiences that taught me how to translate complex data into actionable insights.

🚀 💻 Outside of work and studies, I enjoy working on personal projects that challenge me to apply what I’ve learned in **machine learning** and **AI**. Some of my recent projects include **neural style transfer**, building a **Kanban board web app** and working on some **Computer Graphics** related projects. I'm always looking to deepen my understanding and find practical ways to contribute to the rapidly evolving field of AI.


🌐 Feel free to explore my projects and repositories, and if you’d like to connect, I’m always up for an insightful conversation about tech, AI!
